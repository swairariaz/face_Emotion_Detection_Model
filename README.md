https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25a8bd7b-ea45-49a5-845f-c9a78b213dbf



This project is a **real-time facial emotion detection system** built using **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** techniques. The model is trained on a **facial expression dataset from Kaggle** and can classify emotions into seven categories:  

😠 **Angry** | 🤢 **Disgust** | 😨 **Fear** | 😃 **Happy** | 😐 **Neutral** | 😢 **Sad** | 😲 **Surprise**  

### 🔹 Key Features  
✔️ **Real-time face emotion detection** using OpenCV  
✔️ **Deep learning-based CNN model** for accurate classification  
✔️ **Optimized for real-time performance**  
✔️ **Works with live webcam feed**  
✔️ **Pre-trained model for quick deployment**  

### 🔹 Dataset  
The model is trained on a **facial expression dataset from Kaggle**, which consists of grayscale images (48x48 pixels) of faces expressing different emotions.  

### 🔹 Technologies Used  
- **TensorFlow | Keras** (Deep Learning Framework)  
- **OpenCV** (Face Detection)  
- **NumPy | Pandas** (Data Processing)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Evaluation Metrics)  

### 🔹 Usage  
This project can be used for **human-computer interaction, sentiment analysis, and AI-driven user experiences**.
